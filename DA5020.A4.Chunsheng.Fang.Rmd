#It can be inferred that median trip distance is higher during certain hours which is 5 and 6 hours of the day which is from morning, this could indicate that people are traveling longer distances during those times. Conversely, if the median trip distance is lower during certain hours, it could indicate that people are traveling shorter distances during those times.
